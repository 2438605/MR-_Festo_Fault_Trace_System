## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Unity 2022.3.48f1](https://unity.com/)

### Industry 4.0 

The term Industry 4.0 represents the fundamental changes currently taking place in the production and manufacturing industries. As real-world and VR are merging, modern information and communication technologies have become combined with traditional industrial processes. This redefines numerous areas of production. CPF reflects this new era of Industry 4.0 production paradigm by offering a modular smart factory for teaching and research purposes. 
The Festo Cyber-Physical factory is an advanced training and research platform designed to simulate modern industry 4.0 manufacturing environments. It integrated automation, IOT, AI-driven control system and digital twin technology to provide hands-on learning experiences in smart manufacturing, robotics and industrial networking. 


## AIM OF THIS APPLICATION

•	Bring in the FPS machine into Mixed reality scene.
•	Read all possible low-level data in the machines to identity the machines.
•	Read some high-level nodes creating your own feature in the assignment for FPS-training. 
•	Create a digital twin scene for the application created.
